# Sorting-algorithms

File called *runtime_timer.py* is used to run tests using timeit python module. It contains a *test_sorting_algorithms* function.
It takes one parameter that specifies the size of an array/list of numbers which will be used to test the speed of the sorting algorithms.
Every algorithm is ran 1000 times with the same specified array of numbers to better see the difference in the speed.
