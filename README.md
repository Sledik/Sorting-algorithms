# Sorting-algorithms

File called *runtime_timer.py* is used to run tests using timeit python module. It contains a *test_sorting_algorithms* function.
It takes two parameters. The first one specifies the size of an array/list of numbers (which will be used to test the speed of the sorting algorithms) and the second one specifies the run count (how many times will the algorithm sort the given array).
Every algorithm is ran many times with the same specified array of numbers of a given size to better see the difference in the speed.
